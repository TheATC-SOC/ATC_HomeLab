# ATC_HomeLab
First GitHub project: Homelab environment with VMware + Kali Linux. Includes setup documentation, configs, and notes for hands-on security practice, learning, and future experiments.
This repository will track my hands-on learning as I work toward becoming a cybersecurity professional.  
I’ll be posting project write-ups, configs, and lessons learned along the way.  

Goals  
- Build foundational IT & cybersecurity skills.  
- Gain real-world experience beyond certifications.  
- Explore SOC/SIEM monitoring, networking, and penetration testing.  

Current Setup  
- VMware Workstation installed ✅  
- Kali Linux VM running successfully ✅  

Next Steps  
- Create a second VM (target machine).  
- Begin attack/defense scenarios between VMs.  
- Document walkthroughs, configs, and results here.  

Stay tuned for updates as I continue leveling up!
