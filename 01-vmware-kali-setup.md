## Step 5. Boot Kali Linux

1. Start the VM successfully.
2. Log in using the default credentials:

   - Username: kali
   - Password: kali

## üîí Changing the Default Kali Linux Password

It‚Äôs important to change the default password (`kali`) immediately after your first login to secure your homelab environment.

### Steps to Change Your Password

1. **Open Terminal in Kali Linux.**
2. **Run the password change command:**
   ```bash
   passwd
   ```
3. **Enter your current password when prompted:**
   ```
   Current password: kali
   ```
4. **Enter your new password twice to confirm:**
   ```
   New password: [your_new_password]
   Retype new password: [your_new_password]
   ```
5. **Success message should appear:**
   ```
   passwd: password updated successfully
   ```

#### Tips

- Choose a strong password (at least 8 characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols).
- Write your new password down or store it in a password manager.
- You can change passwords for other users by running:
  ```bash
  sudo passwd [username]
  ```

## Step 6. Configure VM Settings

1. To improve performance, customize the VM resources:
   - Memory: 4 GB (recommended 2 GB, minimum 1 GB)
   - Processors: 4
   - Hard Disk: 80 GB
   - Network Adapter: NAT

This configuration ensures smoother performance and supports multitasking when running penetration testing tools.

# üêû Troubleshooting

- **VM Won‚Äôt Boot:**  
  Confirm your hardware meets requirements and that virtualization is enabled in BIOS/UEFI.

- **Network Issues:**  
  Make sure your VM network adapter is set to NAT or Bridged. Restart the VM after making changes.

- **Login Problems:**  
  Double-check default credentials. If you changed the password and forgot it, you may need to re-import the VM or reset the password.

# ‚úÖ Result

- VMware Workstation installed successfully.
- Kali Linux VM imported and running.
- Verified desktop environment access.
- Resources optimized for better stability and performance.

---

# üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Increase VM resources** if more performance is required.
   - Adjust RAM, CPU, or disk allocations in VMware settings.

2. **Create a second VM (Windows or Ubuntu) to act as a target machine.**
   - Download pre-built images from official sources and repeat the import steps above.

3. **Configure a virtual network for attacker/defender simulations.**
   - Explore VMware‚Äôs virtual networking options or follow guides like [VMware Networking Explained](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workstation-Pro/17.0/com.vmware.workstation.using.doc/GUID-6C3E81E5-4EBA-4E3E-9B38-CCF8A9E7F7D0.html).

4. **Document penetration testing exercises and SOC-style monitoring with tools like Splunk or Wireshark.**
   - Consider keeping a lab journal or repository for your exercises and findings.
