Project 01 â€“ VMware + Kali Linux Setup

Date: Sept 9, 2025
Created by: Wonhee Oh

Objective

Set up the foundation of my cybersecurity homelab by installing VMware Workstation and deploying Kali Linux. This environment will be used for penetration testing, SOC/SIEM experiments, and future red-team vs blue-team labs.

Tools & Technology
Component	Purpose
VMware Workstation 17	Hypervisor for running VMs
Kali Linux (VMware)	Attacker machine with pre-installed security tools
7-Zip	Tool for extracting Kali Linux VM archive
Local Storage (80 GB)	Disk allocation for VM
4 GB RAM / 4 CPU cores	VM resource allocation

Steps Taken

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Download VMware Workstation

Registered for a Broadcom account.

Navigated to Free Downloads â†’ VMware Workstation Pro.


ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Install 7-Zip (to Extract Kali Files)

Downloaded 7-Zip from official site.

Used it to unpack the .7z Kali VM archive.


ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Download Kali Linux Pre-Built VM

From Kaliâ€™s official site, selected Pre-Built Virtual Machine â†’ VMware.

Extracted the .7z archive with 7-Zip.


ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Import Kali VM into VMware

Opened VMware Workstation Player.

Selected Open a Virtual Machine.

Loaded the .vmx file.


ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Boot Kali Linux

Started the VM.

Logged in with default credentials:

Username: kali

Password: kali


ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Configure VM Settings

After importing Kali, I adjusted the VM resources for better performance:

Memory: 4 GB (recommended 2 GB, minimum 1 GB)

Processors: 4

Hard Disk: 80 GB

Network Adapter: NAT

This ensures Kali runs smoothly and allows for multitasking when running penetration testing tools.

Result

âœ… VMware Workstation installed successfully
âœ… Kali Linux VM running inside VMware
âœ… Verified access to full Kali desktop environment
âœ… Resources optimized (CPU/RAM/Storage)



Next Steps

Increase VM resources further if needed.

Create a second VM (Windows/Ubuntu) as a target machine.

Configure network settings for attack/defense labs.

Document penetration testing exercises.
